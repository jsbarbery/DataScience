# DataScience

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This folder contains exercise files from my professional certifications, slightly modified to extend the exercise beyond its original scope.

Throughout my journey in acquiring professional certifications, Google Analytics and Microsoft Data Cience Associate, I've encountered various exercises and projects that have deepened my understanding of different concepts. In this repository, you'll find exercises that I've completed during my certification courses, with additional modifications to showcase my ability to apply these concepts in more advanced scenarios.

Feel free to explore the exercises and modifications. I hope they provide valuable insights into how I approach problem-solving and apply my knowledge in practical scenarios.
